	This file.

testseqs.fasta

	24 unaligned RNA sequences.

testseqs_aligned.fasta

	The alignment of the 24 RNA sequences in testseqs.fasta.

testseqs_nussinov_single_pred.dbn

	The 2nd structure in Vienna format for each of the 24
	sequences in testseqs.fasta as predicted by'nussinov_single'.

testseqs_nussinov_multiple_pred.dbn

	The 2nd structure in Vienna format for each of the 24
	sequences in testseqs.fasta as predicted from the multiple
	alignment in testseqs_aligned.fasta using 'nussinov_multiple'.


testseqs_true_multiple_pred.txt

	The predicted structure for the multiple alignment in 
	testseqs_aligned.fasta, i.e. before conversion to a structure
	for each sequences.

testseqs_true_structure_alignment.txt

	The true structure of the multiple alignment in
	testseqs_aligned.fasta, i.e. before conversion to a structure
	for each sequences.

testseqs_true_structures.dbn

	The true structure for each of the 24 sequences in
	testseqs.fasta constructed by converting
	testseqs_true_structure_alignment.txt into a structure for
	each of the sequences.

test_mcc.txt

	The Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) between the
	predicted structures in testseqs_nussinov_single_pred.dbn,
	testseqs_nussinov_multiple_pred.dbn and the true structures in
	testseqs_true_structures.dbn.
