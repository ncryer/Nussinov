This class implements Nussinov's algorithm
    to predict RNA secondary structure from a
    RNA sequence alone. 
    
    It contains the following methods:
    
    returnVienna(seq,pairs):
    Return the Vienna encoding of a prediction made by
    the Nussinov algorithm
    Input: sequence used for prediction, list of predicted basepairs
    Output: A Vienna encoded string e.g. "..(.)..((..))"
    
    read_fasta("file.fasta"):
    Read a fasta file and store the sequence(s) in a dictionary
    of the form seqDict["seqName"] = "aauu..." 

    
    score_function(x,y):
    A base-pairing score function which positively weights
    Watson-Crick base pairs. Can be modified to accomodate 
    wobble base pairs, etc. 
    
    predict(seq):
    Fills out the score matrix in O(N^3) time and O(N^2) space
    Backtracks through the matrix in O(N) time 
    and outputs a prediction in Vienna format
    
    MatthewsCC(pred,true):
    Calculate and output the Matthews correlation coefficient
    for a prediction given its true/known structure
